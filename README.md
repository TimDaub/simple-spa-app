## Deprecation note

A few days after creating this repo, I discovered that some projects already play with this idea:

- preact has a "No build tools route", which I love: https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/getting-started#no-build-tools-route
- microbundle is a zero-configuration JS bundler: https://github.com/developit/microbundle
